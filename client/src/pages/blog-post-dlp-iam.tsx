                    <h3>Your $5M Security Stack Just Became Swiss Cheese</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's be honest: the DLP and IAM systems executives brag about in boardrooms are failing
                        spectacularly in the AI era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They weren't designed for a world where employees can paste customer databases into
                        ChatGPT, copilots can summarize thousands of HR files in seconds, and AI agents can act
                        autonomously across your business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your defenses are playing checkers while AI threats are playing 4D chess.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why Legacy DLP Is a Sword at a Gunfight</h3>

                    <h4>Static Rules Don't Work Anymore</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>DLP says: "Block files with SSNs or documents labeled Confidential."</li>
                        <li>Reality: An employee uploads your customer database into ChatGPT → and asks,
                            "Summarize the trends."</li>
                        <li>The AI never spits out raw records. Instead, it reveals sensitive business
                            intelligence about your market segments and competitive strategy.</li>
                        <li>DLP sees "a conversation about trends." In reality: you just leaked your moat.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Transformation Blindness</h4>
                    <p>
                        AI doesn't just move data, it reshapes it.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Summarizes confidential reports into harmless-looking overviews.</li>
                        <li>Translates patient records into Spanish (and leaks them offshore in the process).</li>
                        <li>Generates new code from your proprietary algorithms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Legacy DLP can't see any of this. It only looks for patterns and keywords. AI transforms
                        them into leaks in plain sight.
                    </p>

                    <h3>IAM's Identity Crisis</h3>

                    <h4>AI Is Not a Human User</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your IAM system understands usernames, passwords, and roles. It doesn't understand:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI copilots that act on behalf of thousands of employees.</li>
                        <li>Model APIs that process data without logins.</li>
                        <li>Federated AI agents passing data between each other.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Context Matters</h4>
                    <p>
                        IAM asks: "Are you a marketing manager? Okay, here's access to customer data."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AI-era security asks: "You're a marketing manager — but should you really be uploading the
                        entire customer database into Copilot for analysis?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IAM says yes. AI-native privacy says: absolutely not.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The New Threat Landscape</h3>

                    <h4>Data Exfiltration 2.0</h4>
                    <p>
                        Forget USB sticks. The new leak vector is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Harmless" AI summaries of confidential docs.</li>
                        <li>Translation plugins sending PHI to unvetted vendors.</li>
                        <li>Employees pasting entire databases into ChatGPT.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Insider Threat Evolution</h4>
                    <p>
                        Not malicious insiders — but well-meaning staff:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Just getting AI to help with work."</li>
                        <li>Sharing PHI with copilots without realizing the retention risk.</li>
                        <li>Copy-pasting AI outputs that contain sensitive transformations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        They don't think they're leaking data — but they are.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What Actually Works: AI-Native Security</h3>

                    <h4>1. Context-Aware Protection</h4>
                    <p>
                        Not just what the data is → but what it becomes after AI transforms it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2. Dynamic Policy Enforcement</h4>
                    <p>
                        Adaptive rules based on user intent, purpose, and environment.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Zero Trust for AI</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No default trust for copilots, agents, or plugins.</li>
                        <li>Every request verified, every response sanitized, every flow logged.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Business Reality</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$4.45M = Average cost of an AI-related breach (IBM 2024).</li>
                        <li>GDPR / HIPAA fines = Millions more.</li>
                        <li>AI adoption blocked = Lost competitive edge.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The paradox: you need AI to compete, but legacy security makes it dangerous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The answer isn't banning AI but it's evolving your privacy and security infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legacy DLP and IAM aren’t just insufficient — they’re dangerous. They give leaders a false
                        sense of security while AI leaks happen under their noses
                    </p>
